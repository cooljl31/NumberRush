#Numberwang

My first experimentation with React.js: A simple "against the clock" style number based game to help learn German numbers.

##Development
* Installation: `npm install`
* Local server: `npm start`
* Styling: `npm run css:watch`

##Code review
I'm new to React so any performance improvements that can be made will be appreciated as pull requests.

###To do:
* Webpack production config
* Experiment with Redux/Flux for state handling

#Number Rush

My first experimentation with React.js and ServiceWorker: A simple "against the clock" style number based game to help learn German numbers.

##Development
* Installation: `npm install`
* Local server (& hot reloading): `npm start`
* Styling: `npm run css:watch`
* Scripts: `npm run js:build`

##Code review
I'm new to React so any performance improvements that can be made will be appreciated as pull requests. All React-specific stuff is located in [`assets/scripts/src/`](https://github.com/jshjohnson/NumberRush/tree/master/assets/scripts/src)

###To do:
* Add unit tests
* Refactor css
* Experiment with Redux/Flux for state handling 

###Credits:
I felt inspired to build this as a result of [this](http://jnjosh.com/posts/learning-german-with-AVSpeechUtterance/) article. Note to self: Blog more!
